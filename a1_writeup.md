# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** I think it was easier since I'm taking java and already have python expereicne so it was pretty fun.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** I'm learning the basics of python as a high schooler in class, can you generate me 5-7 basic problems that cover true and false? This was one of the prompts, I was speciic in my current state, examples, and number of problems I needed in order for AI to properly generate me an accurate set of practice problems.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them? AI helped me by first explaining what they were and then needing me to fill in to complete it successfully.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers? ASKING ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS, it's better to get more informatoin than less and just get the answer, you learn way more than needed but it's always worth it.
